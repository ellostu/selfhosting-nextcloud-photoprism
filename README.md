## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration and Deployment

This section details the steps to set up and run the solution. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your Linux server.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ellostu/selfhosting-nextcloud-photoprism.git
    cd selfhosting-nextcloud-photoprism
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create `.env` files within the `photoprism/` and `nextcloud/` directories to store sensitive environment variables (e.g., database passwords, admin credentials). These files are crucial for security and are deliberately excluded from Git tracking via `.gitignore`.

    **Example `photoprism/.env`:**
    ```
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_photoprism_db_root_password
    MYSQL_DATABASE=photoprism_db
    MYSQL_USER=photoprism_user
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_photoprism_db_password
    PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_USER=admin_photoprism
    PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_photoprism_admin_password
    ```

    **Example `nextcloud/.env`:**
    ```
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_nextcloud_db_root_password
    MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud_db
    MYSQL_USER=nextcloud_user
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_nextcloud_db_password
    ```
    *Adjust variable names and values to match your specific `docker-compose.yml` configurations and security best practices.*

3.  **Shared Volume Configuration:**
    Ensure the absolute path to your media files on the host system (e.g., `/home/syncthing_user/sync_data/celular_fotos/fotos/ALL_PHOTOS`) is consistently mounted as a volume in both Nextcloud and PhotoPrism's `docker-compose.yml` files. This establishes the shared data layer.

    **Example in `photoprism/docker-compose.yml` (within the `volumes` section of the `photoprism` service):**
    ```yaml
    volumes:
      - /home/syncthing_user/sync_data/celular_fotos/fotos/ALL_PHOTOS:/photoprism/originals # Host path to your photos
      # ... other PhotoPrism volumes
    ```

    **Example in `nextcloud/docker-compose.yml` (within the `volumes` section of the `app` or `nextcloud` service):**
    ```yaml
    volumes:
      - /home/syncthing_user/sync_data/celular_fotos/fotos/ALL_PHOTOS:/var/www/html/data/YOUR_USERNAME/files/Photos # Host path mapped for a specific Nextcloud user
      # OR, for external storage configuration:
      # - /home/syncthing_user/sync_data/celular_fotos/fotos/ALL_PHOTOS:/mnt/external_photos
      # ... other Nextcloud volumes
    ```
    *Note: The exact path within the Nextcloud container (`/var/www/html/data/...`) depends on your Nextcloud setup (e.g., direct user folder mount or external storage configuration).*

4.  **Start the Services:**
    Navigate to each service directory and launch the containers. Using `--pull always` ensures the latest images are used, and `--wait` (if available on your Docker Compose version) enhances deployment reliability by waiting for services to be healthy.

    ```bash
    cd photoprism
    docker compose up -d --build --pull always --wait
    cd ../nextcloud
    docker compose up -d --build --pull always --wait
    ```

5.  **Post-Installation & Access:**
    * Access the web interfaces of Nextcloud and PhotoPrism via their configured ports (e.g., `http://your_server_ip:8080` for Nextcloud and `http://your_server_ip:2342` for PhotoPrism).
    * Complete any initial setup steps (e.g., admin user creation, database connection verification).
    * Initiate indexing in PhotoPrism to discover and catalog your media files.

## üîß Utility Scripts

This project includes auxiliary scripts developed to address specific operational and data management challenges:

* **`photoprism/fix_image_extensions.sh`**:
    * **Purpose:** To tackle real-world data challenges, I've included `fix_image_extensions.sh`. This script was developed to resolve issues with mismatched file extensions and internal metadata (e.g., a `.HEIC` file internally identified as `image/jpeg`), a common hurdle when integrating photo collections from external sources like Google Takeout.
    * **Demonstrates:** Proactive problem-solving, data quality assurance, and the ability to automate complex data correction tasks using shell scripting and `ExifTool`.
